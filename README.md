# Recipe Finder

Final project for Javascript Fundamentals Fall 2021 with Albany Can Code. The goal of this project was to apply what was learned throughout the course, and demonstrate how to use an API, combined with user input, to generate dynamic content. To acheive these goals, I used [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) and their Recipe Search API to create a website capable of gathering recipes from across the internet.

# Usage

The Edamam API being utilized is the recipe search API. The API key for this project is being stored within the javascript for demo purposes, but should you be interested, you could get your own API key (and App ID) for free from https://developer.edamam.com and replace the constants at lines 4 and 5 to build off of my project.
